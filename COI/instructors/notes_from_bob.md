Notes from bob
+ bump wsaf up --> make the point of polyclonal have het early on
starting point would be lets get rid of them --> need monoclonals only
looks monoclonal and why (same thing for )
try to filter out hets at range of different threshdolds
    - dropping samples
    - rounding wsaf
    - this is hard
    ----> clean data set of monoclonals --> this sucks
    - wish we could use everything
      throwing away information
        need something clever = RMCL
        Fws before RMCL


        have participants RMCL
          with multiple different parameters (open questions --> substantially changes conclusion --> just open ended question)


          have them dig into why CI are large or small

          have them dig into monoclonals --> do you beleive w/ wsaf

quagmire at end
